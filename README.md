# Use Machine Learning to Detect Phishing Websites

This repository is my working examples for the Manning LiveProject: [Use Machine Learning to Detect Phishing Websites](https://liveproject.manning.com/project/101/21/use-machine-learning-to-detect-phishing-websites).

## Setup

The liveProject (LP) requires Python 3.7. Create a virtual environment preferably using `virtualenv` and run `pip install -r "requirements"` to install the dependencies. 

The dataset for this LP can be found here in [`Phishing.csv`](https://github.com/sayakpaul/Manning-Phishing-Websites-Detection/blob/master/Phishing.csv).
